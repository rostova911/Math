    <b>Linear Equations</b>
    
    A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
    
    <p>ax + b = 0</p>  
    
    where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are real numbers and x is a variable. This 
    form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that 
    most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may 
    or may not be an x so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <i>x</i> there.
    
    <b>Quadratic Equation</b>
    
    The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
    
      <p>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>  
    
    where <b><i>a, b, c</i></b> are known values and <b><i>x</i></b> is the variable
    or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <b><i>a</i></b> can't be 0.
    
    <b>The area of a circle (A)</b>
    
    <b><i>&pi;</i></b> (Pi) times the radius <b><i>(r)</i></b> squared:
    
      <p>A = &pi; &pi; r<sup>2</sup></p>  
    
    or, when you know the diameter (D):
      A = &pi; / 4&#41; &pi; D^2  
    
    or, when you know the circumference (C):
      A = C^2 / 4 &pi; &pi; 
    
    Intersection
    
    The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A &pi; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    
      A &pi; B = { x : x &pi; A and x &pi; B }  
    
    That is, x is an element of the intersection A &pi; B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
